They are very interesting machines, let's see what Wikipedia\r\n        has to say about them: A train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that\r\n        generally run along a railroad (or railway) track to transport passengers or cargo (also known as \"freight\" or\r\n        \"goods\"). The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning 'to pull, to\r\n        draw'.\r\n\r\n        Motive power for a train is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in a self-propelled multiple\r\n        unit. The term \"engine\" is often used as an alternative to locomotive. Although historically steam propulsion\r\n        dominated, the most common types of locomotive are diesel and electric, the latter supplied by overhead wires or\r\n        additional rails. Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by engine or water-driven cable or wire winch, run\r\n        downhill using gravity, or powered by pneumatics, gas turbines or electric batteries.\r\n\r\n        The track usually consists of two running rails with a fixed spacing, which may be supplemented by additional\r\n        rails such as electric conducting rails (\"third rail\") and rack rails. Monorails and maglev guideways are also\r\n        occasionally used.

These can be useful if you want to\r\n        number you toy trains or model railway signals.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div class=\"centered\">\r\n        <button class=\"blue button2\" onclick=\"window.location.href='./form_int.html';\">integer generation form</button>\r\n        <button class=\"yellow button2\" onclick=\"window.location.href='./form_seq.html';\">sequence generation\r\n            form</button>\r\n        <button class=\"red button2\" onclick=\"window.location.href='./form_string.html';\">string generation form</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"centered map\">\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <a href=\"./index.html\">Home</a>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                        <a href=\"./form_int.html\">Integer generator</a>\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                        <a href=\"./form_seq.html\">Sequence generator</a>\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                        <a href=\"./form_string.html\">String generator</a>\r\n                    </li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"footer\">\r\n        <a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=https://mihai-2-tw.logitrex.ro/index.html\">Check with validator</a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"
